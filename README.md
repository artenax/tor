## About
Cross-compiled in Debian 11 using Mingw. Static build.  
Libraries:
- Zlib 1.2.8
- OpenSSL 1.1.1q
- Libevent 2.1.11

Compatibility with Windows XP is provided by the [One Core API libraries](https://github.com/Skulltrail192/One-Core-API-Binaries/).

## Usage
See torrc file in the archive. It includes examples. Run: `start.bat`  
Please note: Tor is blocked in some countries, and you must use bridges. Only obfs4 bridges work on XP, but I don't provide obfs4proxy.exe yet.  
XP build will not work on other Windows.  
Please report XP bugs in my Issues.
